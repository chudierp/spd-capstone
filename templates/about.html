    <p>GIFs are a useful tool when trying to convey emotions I struggle to verbalize
            Widespread use of emojis might have sparked chatter around the idea that they’re a new language, but I believe short video clips and GIFs are more powerful because they can convey a very specific sense of intimacy.
            
            If I want to show someone that I appreciate their comments or kind words, I use either a GIF of Dwight from “The Office” giving thanks or a teary-eyed Michael Scott from the same show.
            
            Recently, technology has moved forward in a way that supports GIFs as the pinnacle of digital culture, shaping how we communicate, interact, and navigate this world. This further supports my efforts to become a warmer and more emotionally secure person.
            
            Unlike still images, emojis, or text, GIFs add a depth of communication and layers of information into easily shareable pictures. People often use a single GIF to express a wide variety of emotions that can also reveal their beliefs, interests, identity, and mood. The fact that most of the clips come from pop culture makes them even more relatable.
            
            Last year the most popular GIF was of Cardi B. During her guest appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” she let out a reactionary “okurrr” — a moment that has resonated with and been used by millions of people ever since.
            
            The fact that GIFs have become so embedded in our culture has also supported the growth of TikTok, the 2017 social media video app used for creating and sharing short lip-sync, comedy, and talent videos.
            
            Take, for example, the viral TikTok of the sad girl dancing, which has been turned into a meme people use to discuss a multitude of topics, including mental health, work, and money issues. Or kombucha girl, which people use to represent their thought processes when looking at themselves in the mirror or deciding whether to go out.
            
            You likely have to spend only 5 seconds on Twitter before a GIF or viral TikTok crosses your screen.
            
            Keke Palmer recently released merchandise based on a viral clip of herself from a “Vanity Fair” interview. In the clip, she looks at an image of America’s 46th vice president, to which she responds, “I hate to say it. I hope I don’t sound ridiculous. I don’t know who this man is… I mean, he could be walking down the street and I wouldn’t know a thing. Sorry to this man.”
            
            The clip has been making the rounds recently, with many people captioning it with various statements that change the context while still encapsulating the mood.
            
            Because of the nature of GIFs, you can watch them once with the original audio and then watch them again on mute but still be able to understand what’s being said.</p>
